# OrangeLine
OranceLine VCV Plugin

New Modules will first show up, marked with [Beta].
Beta modules are for preview and should not be considered stable.
Functionality can change and no backward compatibility is promised between beta versions of a module.
So problems with upgrading between beta versions may arise.

When a module has reached its stable state the [Beta] mark will disappear.
Modules not marked as beta will maintained in a backward compatible way if possible.
