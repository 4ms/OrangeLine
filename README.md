# OrangeLine
OranceLine VCV Plugin

New modules will first show up marked as [Beta].
Beta modules are published for early adopters and should not be considered stable.
They may even disappear again if the concept behind the module doesn't work es expected.
Functionality can change and no backward compatibility is promised between beta versions of a module.
So problems with upgrading between beta versions may arise.
After collecting feedback from the community and doing the polishing of GUI and functionalityi, those modules will hopefully enter a stable state.

When a module has reached its stable state, the [Beta] mark will disappear.
Modules not marked as beta will maintained in a backward compatible way if possible.

## Fence [Beta]

<p align="center"><img src="res/FenceWork.svg"></p>

Fence is a helpful modul to keep a cv in a certain range if possible.

This module is still in early development and may underly some changes in user interface and functionality.

Trigger functionaty is not yet implemented, so the TRG IN and OUT sockets don't have any functionality yet.

More documentation still to come...
